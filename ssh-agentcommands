========================================== SSH Agent Forwarding ===================================================

==> Run the following command to start the ssh-agent in the background. The ssh-agent stores your SSH keys in memory.
eval $(ssh-agent)

==> Run the following command to verify that the keys are added to the ssh-agent:
ssh-add -l 

==>  Run the following command to add the SSH key to the ssh-agent:
ssh-add -K EC2Tutorial.pem 

==> Run the following command to verify that the keys are added to the ssh-agent:
ssh-add -l 

==>Run the following command to connect to the bastion host. 
ssh -A  ec2-user@ [ip address of public instance] 

==> check if the ssh agent forwarded the private key to the pub instance 

ssh-add -l 

==> Connect to the private instance from the public instance 

ssh -A ec2-user@[private ipv4 of the private instance] 

                OR
# Start the SSH-Agent: 
ssh-agent -s

# Add your private key that allows you to access your infrastructure 
ssh-add -k ~/.ssh/cloud-infra-key.pem

# list the ssh-keys currently available in the ssh-agent
ssh-add -l

# additionally, you can remove a key from the ssh-agent using the following command
ssh-add -d  ~/.ssh/cloud-infra-key.pem
